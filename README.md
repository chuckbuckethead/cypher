# Cypher

A general-purpose, easy-to-use wrapper of the Bouncy Castle cryptography API.

# Install

Use the following dependency in your project:

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.github.chuckbuckethead</groupId>
	<artifactId>cypher</artifactId>
	<version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

# Usage

Cypher exports both asymmectric and symmetric encryption/decryption capabilities via a simple API. The `Cypher` class serves as point of entry.

## Asymmetric encryption

```java
package com.github.chuckbuckethead.cypher.usage;

import com.github.chuckbuckethead.cypher.Cypher;

public class Usage {
  
  public static void main(String... args)
  {
    String phrase = "github";
    RSAKey key = Cypher.generateRSAKey(1024);
    
    System.out.println("public_key:" + key.getPublicKey());
    System.out.println("private_key:" + key.getPrivateKey());
    
    // Encrypt the phrase
    String encryptedPhrase = key.encrypt(phrase);
    System.out.println("encrypted_phrase:" + encryptedPhrase);
    
    // Print the decrypted phrase
    System.out.println("original_phrase:" + key.decrypt(encryptedPhrase));
  }
}
```

## Symmetric encryption

```java
package com.github.chuckbuckethead.cypher.usage;

import com.github.chuckbuckethead.cypher.Cypher;

public class Usage {
  
  public static void main(String... args)
  {
    String phrase = "github";
    BlowfishKey key = Cypher.generateBlowfishKey(128);
    
    System.out.println("key:" + key.getKey());
    
    // Encrypt the phrase
    String encryptedPhrase = key.encrypt(phrase);
    System.out.println("encrypted_phrase:" + encryptedPhrase);
    
    // Print the decrypted phrase
    System.out.println("original_phrase:" + key.decrypt(encryptedPhrase));
  }
}
```
